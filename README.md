# Mys
Welcome to Mys.

Mys is a programming language.

But it is also a challenge.

No documentation is provided. Try to complete the challenges below.

<sub><sup>Trying to deobfuscate or debug the source code is cheating, and sharing large amounts of Mys syntax secrets ruins the fun for all future users. The point of the language is for new users to discover things for themselves. Don't ruin it for others. If you don't like that, then stop using Mys and ignore this whole thing.</sup></sub>

You should submit your source [here](https://goo.gl/forms/aLqKzsJaF54SBiBP2) if you accomplish a challenge. Do not post it or anything, because then people might figure out the syntax. (Hopefully you understand the point of Mys by now. The syntax is supposed to by a *mys*tery)

**Challenge progression**

* "Hello, world!", in under 200 bytes (if it takes you more than 200 bytes to do it anyways, you have probably found a bug in the language that should be reported via PM)
* List of all of the ASCII characters (Mys handles unprintables nicely)
* The first 255 UTF-8 characters (The second column of [this table](http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?names=-&view=2), minus the last character)
* More challenges coming as I create them.
* Print out every even character twice (Like BBDDFFHH, but with the first 255 utf-8 chars.)
* Print out every odd character twice (Like AACCEEGG, but with the first 255 utf-8 chars.)
* Create a binary counter, counting from 0 to 256 (inclusive) in less than or exactly 50 characters. The counter should be right-centered, because place value.

Found a bug? Use the challenge submission form, but say that the challenge is "bug report".
